# gobble

**the last build tool you'll ever need**

## Quick start

Install [gobble-cli](https://github.com/gobblejs/gobble-cli)...

```bash
npm install -g gobble-cli
```

...then [create a gobblefile.js build definition](https://github.com/gobblejs/gobble/wiki/How-to-write-a-gobblefile) in your project's root directory. Then, run gobble:

```bash
gobble
```

## Why another build tool?

There are many good reasons! [Here are a few.](https://github.com/gobblejs/gobble/wiki/Why-another-build-tool%3F)


## Docs

* [How to write a gobblefile](https://github.com/gobblejs/gobble/wiki/How-to-write-a-gobblefile)

Search for 'gobble' on npm to find plugins: https://www.npmjs.org/search?q=gobble


## Caveats

Gobble is still in active development, and may not be ready for primetime yet - APIs may change, and huge swathes of documentation are currently missing. Bear with me!
