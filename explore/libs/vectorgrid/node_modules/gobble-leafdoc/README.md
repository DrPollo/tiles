# gobble-leafdoc

Gobble plugin to generate Leafdoc (üçÇdoc) documentation.

## Installation

I assume you already know the basics of [Gobble](https://github.com/gobblejs/gobble).

```bash
npm i -D gobble-leafdoc
```

And I also assume that you also have some code with [Leafdoc](https://github.com/IvanSanchez/Leafdoc)-style
documentation on it.

## Usage

In your `gobblefile`, run the `leafdoc` gobble transform with a `output` option, like so:

```javascript
var gobble = require( 'gobble' );
module.exports = gobble( 'src' ).transform( 'leafdoc', {
  output: 'documentation.html'
});
```

Any Leafdoc-specific options can be specified in the transform options, for example:

```javascript
module.exports = gobble( 'src' ).transform( 'leafdoc', {
  output: 'documentation.html',
  templateDir: 'assets/custom-leafdoc-templates',
  leadingCharacter: '@'
});
```

Additionally, the `files` option can be used to order and filter files to be 
parsed with Leafdoc. This is useful when creating subsets of documentation, or
adding some leading/trailing content. The `files` option is a [`minimatch`](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch)
pattern, or an array of minimatch patterns.

```javascript
module.exports = gobble( 'src' ).transform( 'leafdoc', {
  output: 'documentation.html',
  files: [
     'first-very-important-thing.leafdoc',
     '**/*.js',
     'credits.leafdoc'
  ]
});
```
